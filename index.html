              <p class="activity-description">Our visit to Foundever began with a warm welcome by their team, 
                complete with refreshments before taking part in an eye-opening orientation about being a global leader in customer 
                experience. The sessions with their operations and IT teams gave us with genuine insights into how they manage 
                large-scale customer support operations, from customer journey mapping through cybersecurity. 
                This was followed by Ms. Zoe Diaz De Rivera of IBPAP, who presented a vivid picture of the Philippines 
                IT-BPM sector, a sector currently employing more than 1.7 million Filipinos and which is still going strong 
                through innovations such as automation and AI. Following the presentations, Ms. Zoe and the team took us on a 
                guided tour of their facilities including their staff-friendly canteen providing affordable but nutritious 
                meals (I personally like the corn dog - 10/10) with complimentary coffee from vending machines, tidy locker 
                spaces that can hold thousands of their employees providing a glimpse into the considerate workplace 
                they have designed.</p>

              <p class="activity-description">Facilitated by Atty. Yves Gonzalez, Google Philippines' Head of Government Affairs 
                and Public Policy, he provided insightful tips on how Google manages public relations and responds to pressing 
                social concerns through creative and accessible technologies. Atty. Gonzalez emphasized Google's mission to make 
                the internet more inclusive by developing products that directly respond to real-world problems. He also provided 
                us with a peek into the company's unique work culture—especially how they manage workloads, which they term as 
                "bandwidth," and how Google prioritize their employees' well-being. His own personal stories and insights made 
                the experience even more inspiring, especially before we got to see the amazing Google facilities for ourselves.</p>

              <p class="activity-description">While we were at Teleperformance Philippines, we were greeted by Ms. Beatrice Grace Bonjibod, 
                Brand Marketing Specialist, who led us to the business beyond its popular BPO reputation. She emphasized how Teleperformance 
                is a world leader in digitally integrated business services, using artificial intelligence to close industry gaps and maximize 
                their operations. Her presentation enlightened us to how AI is smoothly integrated into their operations, extending the limits 
                of what we know as customer service. Following the enlightening orientation, we had the thrilling opportunity to explore their 
                contemporary facilities, such as the TP Innovation and Solutions Hub. We also met with their Human Resources group, where we 
                inquired about hiring, career development, and opportunities in the company—an experience that was educational and enlightening.</p>

              <h3 class="activity-title">Kollab</h3>
              <p class="activity-description">Our experience at Kollab was nothing less than inspiring, starting with Ralph Vincent Regalado, 
                Chief Scientist and Head of AI of the company, who showed us a glimpse of what Kollab is doing to stay ahead in providing 
                cloud-first solutions to more than 650 businesses across Southeast Asia. He envisioned innovation founded on real-world impact.
                This was followed in powerful fashion by Jazmine Calma, Senior Quality Assurance Engineer, reminding us that although 
                compensation is important, an organization's culture has much more to say about individual and professional development. 
                Her commentary regarding the selection of workplaces which promote teamwork, mental health, and on-going improvement was 
                meaningful particularly as she proudly shared that Kollab has been named one of Asia's Best Workplaces 2023 to 2025. 
                Toni-Jan Keith Monserrat, who is AI and Data Senior Principal Engineer, next infused vigor and wisdom as he looked at 
                how AI evolves from theory to practical application from forecasting real-estate properties price worth to other sectors 
                illustrating versatility and strength of data-centric innovation. In conclusion, Miguel Siriban, a UI/UX Designer and 
                Developer, shared precious, practical advice on how to build an engaging developer portfolio one that is narrative-driven, 
                shows passion, and is job-targeted, the job we all hope to acquire. Overall, the experience provided not only technical 
                learning, but a new sense of direction as future professionals.</p>

        <h3 class="activity-title">Asian Development Bank</h3>
        <p class="activity-description">It was indeed such an eye-opener, our tour in the Asian Development Bank (ADB). We were first 
                 guided through a series of strict security inspections—an immediate testament to how seriously the institution prioritizes 
                 safety and protocol. Going towards the ADB library, passing through hallways that showcased a variety of historical artifacts 
                 and displays. Within the library, we were stunned by the sheer number of books and more surprised to 
                 discover an exclusive Starbucks, ideal for a quiet read. Next, we went to the ADB History Gallery, which presented the 
                 organization's milestones, its logos' evolution, branches, and leadership, gaining a better appreciation for its contribution 
                 to Asia's growth. The tour also went through their award-winning green buildings, such as LEED Platinum and Gold a prestigious 
                 award recognizes the building's high standards in sustainable design and environmental performance. We also walked past their 
                 lively cafeteria, where staff members indulge in varied Asian food in a chic, technologically equipped area with wireless 
                 charging points and huddle areas for casual meetups. At the multifunction hall, we were served carefully prepared snacks as 
                 we awaited the main program. The high spot was in the Fireside Chat with ADB's Infrastructure and Technology Division, where
                 IT leaders shared their journeys, insights into global development work, and the growing importance of tech in solving 
                 real-world problems. Not only did we hear inspiring stories, but these opportunities themselves, be it grants, internships,
                 or career guidance, encouraged us to dream bigger and aim for a place in international organizations like ADB.</p>

        <h3 class="activity-title">Microsourcing</h3>
        <p class="activity-description">Our visit to MicroSourcing was both insightful and inspiring. The program began with a warm 
                welcome from CEO Ms. Heidee Enriquez, who emphasized the importance of digital skills, adaptability, and lifelong learning 
                in today’s fast-changing job market. We then learned about MicroSourcing’s journey as a pioneer in outsourcing, its global 
                reach, and how it empowers Filipino talent through flexible work and career growth. A guided tour of their modern, 
                collaborative workspace gave us a feel of what a supportive and innovative work environment looks like. One of the most 
                valuable parts was the LinkedIn workshop, where we received hands-on tips on building a strong professional profile and 
                preparing for real-world job hunting. The day ended with open conversations, gratitude, and a renewed sense of direction 
                for our future careers.</p>

              <h3 class="activity-title">Intramurus</h3>
              <p class="activity-description">Our intramurus journey was a strong step into the past, strolling through the very bosom of the
                 Philippines' lush and complicated history. Among the highlights was the visit to the beautiful Minor Basilica and Metropolitan 
                 Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception—more popularly referred to as the Manila Cathedral—situated across the monument of King 
                 Carlos IV of Spain. As we were walking into the walled city, our tour guide told us about the centuries-old structures, each 
                 with a chapter of the country's colonial history. The scariest part of the tour was going to the old storage room converted 
                 into a torture room, where the Japanese used it during their occupation. It was eerie to know how many lives, including the 
                 innocent children's, were lost within these walls. The tour ended at Museo ni Rizal, a shrine that genuinely respects the life 
                 and work of Dr. José Rizal, asserting anew his lasting influence on our country's identity and freedom.</p>

              <p class="activity-description">Our journey to Tagaytay was refreshing and unforgettable. On our ascent, we were greeted by 
                the dense shroud of fog that imparted an air of mystery to the ride. Our first destination was the People's Park in the Sky, 
                where we were given a stunning panoramic view of the Taal Volcano—its radiance shone through even amidst the fog. The place 
                also had a selection of local pasalubong shops, ideal for bringing home a bit of the experience. We topped off the day by 
                going to Sky Ranch, where we maximized our time on rides, feeling the cool wind, and walking around the lively area. It was 
                an ideal way to relax and end the day with laughter and memories.</p>

              <p class="activity-description">Our last destination took us to the fresh and beautiful city of Baguio. Although it was not 
                strawberry season, we still had time to shop around the numerous stalls selling local pasalubongs and were given a glimpse of 
                the strawberry farm from the outside. Following a short rest and refreshing ourselves at our hotel, we proceeded to the 
                Philippine Military Academy, where we toured its grand grounds and saw historic planes and tanks, some of which had been used 
                in the Korean War. The day went on with visits to iconic destinations such as The Mansion, Good Shepherd, and other popular 
                favorites. At night, we were immersed in the bustling Baguio Night Market, where a mix of street food, second-hand garments 
                (ukay-ukay), and bargain deals made our experience an energetic culmination.</p>
